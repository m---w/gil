Geometry Interaction Library


description
-----------

GIL is a set of Pure Data abstractions, aiming at the interaction of geometric objects or mouse cursor inside GEM.
It does not depend on any external libraries except GEM.

See gil_EXAMPLE.pd for a little example patch.

This library is still work in progress.
